- TODO VPO: describe legacy

The *erosiekaart*, the product initialising SAGA-WaTEM was initially developed 
at KU Leuven, by members of the current  Geography and Tourism Research 
Division of the Department Earth and Environmental Sciences, formerly the
Laboratory for Experimental Geomorphology.

Main developer was Gert Verstraeten, ???

Since 2016, updates to the code and the maintenance of
the Github SAGA-WaTEM site is now mostly done by [Fluves](http://www.fluves.com) 
and  funded by [Departement Omgeving](https://omgeving.vlaanderen.be)

The contributors of Fluves and Departement Omgeving are Johan Van de Wauw, 
Daan Renders, Sacha Gobeyn, Seth Callewaert and Jarne Amerlinck. 
The supervision and coordination of the developments is done by
Petra Deproost (Departement Omgeving). Model developments by Fluves are
scientifically supported by KU Leuven.

When using SAGA-WaTEM, reference should be provided to the current model code 
on GitHub and to the following publications:
